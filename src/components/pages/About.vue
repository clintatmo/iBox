          <p>The Pitbull Box started out with the 2 of us wanting to get back in shape after gaining a lot of post-wedding weight. So we took the conventional approach; we went to the gym. After a short while, unfortunately, we got bored (or lazy) and stopped going. Not quite ready to give up, we did the next thing so many before us have done; we decided to work-out at home. We tried our hand at functional fitness, and to our surprise (and delight) it caught on.</p>
          <p>A few family members and friends started tagging along. Within a few months more and more people hopped on our little bandwagon, wanting to join in on our newfound hobby.</p>
          <p>Our passion to help others on their journey to become a healthier, fitter &amp; stronger version of themselves, is what fuels us nowadays. We&rsquo;re aiming to keep you focussed on the race&hellip;</p>
          <p>Keeping your eye on the prize...</p>
          <p>Always striving for the max&hellip;</p>
          <p><strong>Pushing you to greatness!</strong></p>
