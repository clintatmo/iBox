            The Pitbull Box started out with the 2 of us wanting to get back in shape after gaining a lot of post-wedding weight. So we took the conventional approach; we went to the gym.
            After a short while, unfortunately, we got bored (or lazy) and stopped going.
            Not quite ready to give up, we did the next thing so many before us have done; we decided to work-out at home. We tried our hand at functional fitness, and to our surprise (and delight) it caught on. A few family members and friends started tagging along. Within a few months more and more people hopped on our little bandwagon, wanting to join in on our newfound hobby.
            Our passion to help others on their journey to become a healthier, fitter & stronger version of themselves, is what fuels us nowadays.
            We’re aiming to keep you focussed on the race…
            Keeping your eye on the prize...
            Always striving for the max…
            Pushing you to greatness!
